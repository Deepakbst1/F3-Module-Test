# Nasa Picture Of The Day
Build a web page that retrieves data from NASA's Picture of the Day API, allowing the user to select a date from a form and send it in the query params. The page should allow the user to save their searches to local storage and display their past searches on the page. The page should also display the current image of the day when it loads.
